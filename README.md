# rfid-soundbox
This is a modular prototype designed to mimick the famous gramophone using rfid technology - similar to the speaker system from the Ikea Frekvens collection (https://www.ikea.com/us/en/files/pdf/27/28/27281cda/frekvens_pr_kit.pdf).
Check out the rfid soundbox documentation pdf for a more detailed description.
